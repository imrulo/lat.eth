# Temperature Check: LAT.ETH Educational Initiative - 12,000 Latin Lovers Through Cultural Engagement in Serbia and Balkans

## üéì **Educational Mission: Advancing ENS Adoption Through Blockchain Education**

**LAT.ETH Educational Initiative** (led by imrulo.eth) proposes advancing ENS adoption in Serbia through blockchain education combined with engaging cultural activities, starting with Serbia as our pilot region. We will use Latin dance (salsa, reggaet√≥n, bachata, merengue) as engagement tools to attract Latin Lovers to educational sessions about Ethereum, blockchain technology, ENS domains, and decentralized wallets, with a clear strategy for expansion to other Balkan countries.

### **üéØ What Makes This Special**
- **Educational Focus**: The main goal is blockchain education, not cultural preservation
- **Cultural Engagement**: Dance events as tools to attract Latin Lovers to learning
- **Replicable Model**: Serbia pilot with clear expansion to 6 Balkan countries
- **Progressive Funding**: Milestone-based unlock system (3,000 USDC per quarter)
- **POAP Integration**: Educational recognition tokens for learning participation
- **LAT.ETH as Educational Tool**: Gateway to web3 learning through hands-on experience
- **Scalable Model**: Serbia as pilot, then expansion to Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo
