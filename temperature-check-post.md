# Temperature Check: LAT.ETH Cultural Defense Initiative - 1000 Latino Identities Through Latin Dance in Serbia

## üåç **Cultural Defense Mission: Evangelizing ENS to Latinos Across the Balkans Through Latin Dance**

**LAT.ETH Cultural Defense Initiative** (led by imrulo.eth) proposes evangelizing ENS to the entire Latino community across the Balkans through interactive Latin dance workshops, starting with Serbia as our pilot region. We will use Latin dance (salsa, reggaet√≥n, bachata, merengue) as the cultural entry point to preserve Spanish language and Latino identity through ENS (.eth) adoption, with a clear expansion strategy to other Balkan countries.

### **üéØ What Makes This Special**
- **Regional Evangelization Strategy**: Starting in Serbia, expanding to all Balkan countries
- **Cultural Defense Mission**: Defending Spanish language and Latino identity through blockchain
- **Ambitious Scale**: 20 events over 5 months, 1000 new ENS users in Serbia
- **Progressive Funding**: Cultural milestone-based unlock system (3,000 USDC per month)
- **POAP Integration**: Cultural recognition tokens for participation
- **LAT.ETH Identity**: Cultural, historical, and identity domain for Latino community
- **Scalable Model**: Serbia as pilot, then expansion to Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo

## üíÉ **Event Structure: Latin Dance + ENS Onboarding**

### **Cultural Integration Approach**
1. **Latin Dance Workshops**: Salsa, Reggaet√≥n, Bachata, Merengue
2. **Cultural Connection**: Spanish language and Latino heritage celebration
3. **ENS Education**: Blockchain basics and web3 introduction
4. **LAT.ETH Onboarding**: Free subdomain claiming (e.g., maria.lat.eth)
5. **POAP Recognition**: Cultural participation tokens

### **Why LAT.ETH Matters: Cultural Identity Revolution**
**LAT.ETH is not just any subdomain** - it represents:
- **LATino**: Individual Latino identity
- **LATinoam√©rica**: Latin American heritage
- **LATina**: Latina feminine identity
- **LATinos**: Latino masculine identity
- **LATinas**: Latina feminine identity

**When someone claims `maria.lat.eth`:**
- They're claiming their **cultural identity in the digital world**
- They're **defending their Spanish language heritage**
- They're **creating a permanent digital identity** (no expiration date)
- They're **paying zero dollars** for their cultural identity

## üåü **ENS DAO Alignment**

### **Perfect Fit for Public Goods Working Group**
- **User Onboarding**: Bringing 1000 Spanish speakers to ENS ecosystem in Serbia
- **Regional Expansion**: Pilot in Serbia, then expand to 6 more Balkan countries
- **Global Accessibility**: Expanding to underrepresented regions (Balkans)
- **Cultural Diversity**: Defending Spanish language and Latino identity through web3
- **Public Good**: Cultural preservation as a public good for the ENS ecosystem
- **Scalable Model**: Replicable approach for other regions worldwide

### **Measurable Impact**
- **1000 new ENS users** preserving Latino heritage in Serbia
- **1000+ cultural identity subdomains** under LAT.ETH
- **Cultural community building** in Serbia (pilot region)
- **Spanish language preservation** through blockchain technology
