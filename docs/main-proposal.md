## Executive Summary

Livadance DOO proposes organizing **48 educational workshops** in Serbia and Balkan countries over 12 months, combining **blockchain education with Latin dance events** as an engagement tool to introduce Latin Lovers to the ENS ecosystem. This initiative uses the universal appeal of Latin dance (salsa, reggaet√≥n, bachata, merengue) as a **cultural hook to attract Latin Lovers** to educational sessions about Ethereum, blockchain technology, ENS domains, and decentralized wallets. The main objective is **educational**: teaching Latin Lovers about web3 technology, with dance serving as an attractive entry point.

**Key Educational Impact:**
- **12,000 new ENS users** educated about blockchain technology
- **12,000+ ENS subdomains** created under LAT.ETH (e.g., maria.lat.eth, carlos.lat.eth)
- **POAP recognition tokens** celebrating educational participation
- **Progressive funding unlock** based on educational milestone achievements
- **Blockchain education** delivered through engaging cultural activities

**Why LAT.ETH as Educational Tool:**
LAT.ETH serves as an **educational gateway** that makes blockchain technology accessible and memorable. When someone claims `maria.lat.eth`, they're not just getting a web3 identity - they're **learning about blockchain technology** through a hands-on and engaging experience that combines education with cultural activities.
