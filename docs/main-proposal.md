## Advancing ENS Adoption Through Educational Dance Events

**Submitted by:** Livadance DOO, Serbia  
**Grant Program:** ENS DAO Small Grants  
**Requested Amount:** 15,000 USDC  
**Project Duration:** 5 months  
**Framework:** Logical Framework Matrix  
**Submission Date:** [To be filled]

## Logical Framework Structure

This project is structured following the **Logical Framework Matrix** methodology, which organizes the entire project into four hierarchical levels:

1. **GOAL (Development Objective):** Advance ENS adoption and blockchain education in Serbia and the Balkans
2. **PURPOSE (Project Objective):** Create a sustainable educational model for ENS onboarding using cultural engagement
3. **COMPONENTS (Products/Results):** Educational infrastructure, specialized personnel, ENS technology and marketing
4. **ACTIVITIES (Specific Tasks):** Detailed breakdown of all project activities  

---

## Executive Summary

Livadance DOO proposes to organize **20 educational workshops** in Serbia over 5 months, combining **blockchain education with Latin dance events** as an engagement tool to introduce participants to the ENS ecosystem. This initiative uses the universal appeal of Latin dance (salsa, reggaetón, bachata, merengue) as a **cultural hook to attract participants** to educational sessions about Ethereum, blockchain technology, ENS domains, and decentralized wallets. The primary objective is **educational**: teaching participants about web3 technology, with dance serving as an engaging entry point.

**Key Educational Impact:**
- **1000 new ENS users** educated about blockchain technology
- **1000+ ENS subdomains** created under LAT.ETH (e.g., maria.lat.eth, carlos.lat.eth)
- **POAP recognition tokens** celebrating educational participation
- **Progressive funding unlock** based on educational milestone achievements
- **Blockchain education** delivered through engaging cultural activities

**Why LAT.ETH as Educational Tool:**
LAT.ETH serves as an **educational gateway** that makes blockchain technology accessible and memorable. When someone claims `maria.lat.eth`, they're not just getting a web3 identity - they're **learning about blockchain technology** through a hands-on, engaging experience that combines education with cultural activities.
