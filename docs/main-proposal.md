## Defending Spanish Language & Latino Identity Through Blockchain Technology

**Submitted by:** Livadance DOO, Serbia  
**Grant Program:** ENS DAO Small Grants  
**Requested Amount:** 15,000 USDC  
**Project Duration:** 5 months  
**Submission Date:** [To be filled]

## Executive Summary

Livadance DOO proposes to organize **20 interactive Latin dance workshops** in Serbia over 5 months, with integrated ENS ecosystem onboarding specifically designed to **defend and promote Spanish language and Latino identity** through blockchain technology. This initiative goes beyond simple user onboarding - it's a **cultural defense project** that uses the universal appeal of Latin dance (salsa, reggaetón, bachata, merengue) to introduce Spanish speakers and Spanish language lovers to the ENS ecosystem through their cultural identity.

**Key Cultural & Identity Impact:**
- **1000 new ENS users** connected to their Latino heritage
- **1000+ cultural identity subdomains** under LAT.ETH (e.g., maria.lat.eth, carlos.lat.eth)
- **POAP recognition tokens** celebrating Latino cultural participation
- **Progressive funding unlock** based on cultural milestone achievements
- **Spanish language preservation** through blockchain technology

**Why LAT.ETH Matters:**
LAT.ETH is not just any subdomain - it represents **LATino, LATinoamérica, LATina, LATinos, LATinas**. It's a **cultural, historical, and identity domain** that connects users directly to their Hispanic heritage. When someone claims `maria.lat.eth`, they're not just getting a web3 identity - they're claiming their **cultural identity in the digital world**.
