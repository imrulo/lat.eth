## Executive Summary

**Project Name**: LAT.ETH Cultural Defense Initiative  
**Organization**: Livadance DOO, Serbia  
**Grant Request**: 15,000 USDC  
**Duration**: 5 months (20 weeks)  
**Framework**: Logical Framework Matrix  
**Target Impact**: 1,000 new ENS users, 1,000+ subdomain claims  

**Innovation**: First-ever combination of Latin dance workshops with ENS ecosystem onboarding, creating a unique cultural pathway to blockchain adoption in Serbia, structured through the Logical Framework Matrix for maximum impact and accountability.

## Logical Framework Structure

This project is organized following the **Logical Framework Matrix** methodology in four hierarchical levels:

1. **GOAL (Development Objective):** Defend and preserve Latino identity through blockchain
2. **PURPOSE (Project Objective):** Create sustainable network of Latino digital identities
3. **COMPONENTS (Products/Results):** Infrastructure, personnel, technology and marketing
4. **ACTIVITIES (Specific Tasks):** Detailed breakdown of all activities

---

## Project Concept

### What We're Doing
Livadance DOO will organize 4-6 interactive Latin dance workshops in Belgrade and Novi Sad, Serbia, with integrated ENS ecosystem onboarding. Each 3-hour workshop combines:

1. **Hour 1**: Latin dance instruction (salsa, mambo, cha-cha-cha)
2. **Hour 2**: ENS and blockchain introduction
3. **Hour 3**: Hands-on ENS onboarding and subdomain creation

### Why This Approach Works
- **Cultural Engagement**: Dance creates a comfortable, non-intimidating environment
- **Memorable Experience**: Physical activity + technology creates lasting impressions
- **Community Building**: Shared cultural experience fosters ongoing engagement
- **Accessibility**: Reduces technical barriers through guided, hands-on learning
